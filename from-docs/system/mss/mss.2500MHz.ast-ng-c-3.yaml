  frequency: 2499.99           # MHz - center frequency of the forward link at the edge of the band
  bandwidth: 0.01              # MHz
  tx_power_density: -500       # dBW/Hz - no info - system description only for receiver
  noise_temperature: 500       # K
  adjacent_ch_selectivity: 15  # dB
  # NOTE: ACS is given as a mask.
  # Calculating your own ACS would let you not overstate rx interference

  polarization_loss: 0         # dB
  # NOTE: consider using 3dB polarization loss with P.619
